							<h1>Data Report: Transport for Wales</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> A major component of The Data Professional course was to plan and execute a data analysis plan using data from the Welsh Annusl Survey regarding transport in Wales.</br> 
						The following information includes my reports, code samples and findings from that assignment.</p>
						<p><u>Background</u></br>
The Welsh transport network is made up of “trunk roads” that span most of the country (see figure 1) and an extensive rail and bus network also serves most areas (see figures 2 & 3). If we compare figures 2, 3 and 4, we can see that a lot of the public transport links are concentrated in the most populated areas. However, there are still impressive amounts of public transport facilities in the more rural ones, too. This is likely because Wales is also home to a variety of areas of natural beauty to which transport can act as a gateway, so the extensive links here are no surprise (Transport for Wales, 2023, From rail to trail).</br>
 The dataset we are looking at consists of 42 tables taken from the annual National Survey. It has a sample size of 14,800 that is chosen using 24,000 values from the Royal Mail’s Small User Postcode Address File (Welsh Government, 2013). The survey consisted of 132 questions, however not all respondents would be asked every question. Certain topics, such as specific questions on transport and health, were only asked to a sub-sample (Welsh Government, 2013). This is evident in the tables where sample sizes are listed as significantly lower than the 14,800 we are expecting. For example, the question “Please say what you think overall about the state of the transport system in Wales nowadays?” was asked to one out of 3 sub-samples (Welsh Government, 2013). </br>
 The dataset shows the mean satisfaction scores recorded for the transport system in Wales against various characteristics also recorded. Overall I would say that the characteristics included do allow us insight into the impact they may have on the satisfaction rating. One positive is that certain categories (such as ages and life satisfaction) have been aggregated into groups to avoid small values that may not be as precise (such as table 9 and 10). However, one negative is that the tables have been constructed in a way that makes it difficult to attempt to rebuild the original data in any way. For example, table 17 allows us to see the percentage of men and women who have access to a car, but it is not possible to see how the sample is split between those 2 demographics. This information would allow us to add weight to our analysis and account for any unintended bias or blind spots. </br>
<u>Overall satisfaction: Tables 1-14</u></br>
14 tables in the dataset pertain to the mean satisfaction rating (a score out of 10) of groups of respondents. The sample size for these tables is 4600 as it is only based on sub-sample 3. This is not the case for Table 14 (Overall satisfaction with state of transport system in Wales, by feeling of safety travelling by public transport after dark) which has a sample size of 3900 presumably because this is the only available group who answered both relevant questions. </br>
 The positives for these 14 tables include the specificity of the different groups used. The factors used, such as gender, feelings of safety after dark, age and employment status are insightful choices that could have effects on the overall satisfaction rating. The confidence intervals, which are used to estimate how these values might look when expanded to the wider population, are also useful for evaluating how well these values represent opinions. </br>
<u>Demographics by “Has access to a car”: Tables 15-22</u></br>
8 tables give further information on the demographics of the respondents and how these intersect. These can be used to look further into the reasoning behind satisfaction rates and help construct possible relationships between factors. </br>
 As car ownership was a standard question asked to all participants, the sample size is 14,800 (the full dataset). Because of this, the values are precise or reasonably precise. There are only 8 tables in this sub-dataset as opposed to the 14 previously, however access to a car as a key datapoint appears again in other sub-datasets and adds a lot of value. </br>
<u>Demographic by “Ease of Getting to a GP Surgery or Hospital”: Tables 23-38</u></br>
This sub-dataset looks more into the differences between demographics and their ability to travel to a GP surgery or hospital. This set is made up of 16 tables split evenly between journeys to the GP and journeys to the hospital and the same 8 data points are used for both. </br>
Similar to the question on satisfaction with transport in Wales, the 2 questions regarding travelling to a GP or hospital were only asked to participants who had been to one of the institutions within the previous 12 months. Here, we have sacrificed a larger sample size for more reliable data. It is arguable that participants who had an appointment over a year ago would not produce reliable, up-to-date data. </br>
 One negative about this subset is that, due to the variety of answers available to participants, some of the smaller percentages become less precise and less reliable. We did not see this to the same extent in the previous subsets. This is something we will need to keep in mind during our data analysis. </br>
<u>Demographics by “Feeling of safety when travelling by public transport”: Tables 39-42</u></br>
 This is the smallest dataset with only 4 tables included. Similarly to the previous set, a lot of results are not as reliable as some due to small numbers of participants choosing some options. In this case, only 5% of the 12,800 participants answered that they felt very unsafe so all estimates based on this are not as reliable as the larger groups. </br>
<u>Data Analysis Plan</u></br>
 For our analysis of this dataset, we are going to focus on the satisfaction ratings and what factors may relate to this. We will look at trends in satisfaction and what this might tell us about the demographics present and what further data points might impact this. Using the further sub-datasets focused on specific characteristic (such as ease travelling to a GP/hospital by access to a car), we can then explore the possible relationships between them, and perhaps come up with hypothetical explanations. </br>
  We will look at data points with satisfaction ratings that are below the average 5.9. We will then evaluate these datapoints throughout the 3 sub-datasets to evaluate their scores, such as how close to the average they fall. Using these constructed profiles, we can build visualisations to determine if trends exist and how significant they might be. We will also look into a few basic data points, such as age and gender, in more detail from the start as any significant trends in these areas will be of particular interest. </br>
 We will prep the data by simplifying the row and column names and also marking arrays that contain  less-precise data. Our first point of call will be to aggregate our first 14 tables based on satisfaction. This is simply to speed up the process of evaluating the overall ratings and identify our below-average areas. We will use code to select rows with a mean below the average of 5.9. We will then do the same with the upper and lower intervals to see if this results in any significant differences, such as an upper interval being significantly over the mean. We will still look into these factors for the sake of thoroughness. If this does not give us many lines of enquiry, we will also generate linear regression graphs using MatPlotLib in case visualisations offer us more insight into possible relationships, for example, if a particular characteristic (such as age or WIMD score) shows significant variations. </br>
Once we have identified our key factors, we will then identify the remaining tables that are most relevant to our analysis. For example, if users without a car have below average satisfaction, we will then evaluate the same users throughout the remaining tables (such as access to a car against life satisfaction or WIMD score). Using a mix of loops and lists, we will then use code to comb through the relevant tables (in this example, users without access to a car), to build a profile of those users such as what their typical gender is, or how likely are they to live in an urban or rural area, or their ease of access to facilities. </br>
 In identifying trends, we want to ensure that we are only focusing on strong indications of trends. For this reason, we will also look at the confidence intervals when constructing our results. To do this, any calculations or visualisations we make will include a lower and upper interval calculation as a precaution as mentioned previously. If this shows any significant difference in our trends or results, we can take this into account and this will show the accuracy of our findings. </br>
 For our final results, we will present visualisations to show the proportions and trends we have uncovered. We will focus on using linear regression graphs to show possible trends and pie charts to show the proportions of the demographics. These will go alongside statistics showing the possible profiles of participants that gave the lowest satisfaction and the likelihood of them choosing other outcomes. Where possible (and if it is deemed useful) we will also compare some distinct groups with others if a strong difference is shown. This knowledge will allow Transport for Wales to identify areas for improvement or further research. </br>
