							<h1>Collaborative Discussion 2</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Our second collaborative discussion focused on GDPR and it's place in our respective companies. This assignment pushed me to look more critically at our data protection policies and my own understanding of them. It was also very interesting to hear more about other peoples experiences in different sectors, such as healthcare, banking and aviation.</p>

									<h3>Assignment</h3>
									<blockquote><p>Download and Read ‘Communication: Data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond – taking stock (COM/2019/374)’.</p>

<p>Also read the GDPR Regulation at: Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>

<p>Now review your (or an) organisation’s IT Code of Conduct and reflect on:</p>

    <p>Best practices, including those encompassing Master Data Management (see Unit 3). </p>
    <p>Areas that can be improved.</p>
    <p>Incidents (anonymously) and your role as a computing professional.</p>
    <p>What could have been done to improve the situation.</p>

<p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth. It will be a component of the e-portfolio, which you can submit at the end of the module for feedback.</p></blockquote>

							<h3>Initial Post</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/laptop with hands.jpg" alt="A woman typing on a laptop." /></span The GDPR has gained a lot of significant exposure in the EU and UK since its implementation and continues to do so. Several non-EU countries, such as Japan and Australia, have modelled similar regulations and laws on it (Heine and Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021).</p>

<p>The 6 guiding principles of GDPR are:</br>

    Data must be processed lawfully and transparently.</br>
    Data should be collected for specific, defined purposes.</br>
    The data should also be accurate and limited to only what is necessary.</br>
    The data should be kept in a form where the data subjects are identifiable for only as long as necessary.</br>
    Finally, any data should be processed in a way that ensure security and privacy for the data subjects involved (European Parliament, 2016).</br></p>

<p>Having read my organisation’s various policies on data (and working with it extensively), I have come to the following assumptions as to it’s effectiveness.</p>

 <p>First, I would say that the company uses Master Data Management effectively (Profisee, 2018). All student data is stored centrally in a cloud-based database. It is not possible to download local copies of this database or make any changes to the data structure, however we are able to download reports based on the master data. There are also specific “permissions” that allow and disallow staff members from accessing or changing certain information so the data included is kept accurate and secure. The master data does rely on accurate input by staff members and students and so user error can be an issue.</p>

<p> However, there are certain processes within the company where this same level of accuracy and security has not been met and the concept of master data is not utilised. For example, there are regular reports that require intense manual construction and aggregation from multiple other reports and data sources. These are put together using Excel and some basic functions and filters. This level of manual aggregation is very susceptible to human error or misjudgement which could lead to the incorrect processing or even distribution of data which would go against GDPR (European Parliament, 2016). The data used does come from the master data source but is subject to a lot of human checking and transformation.</p>

<p> In order to improve this, I think there should be more flexibility around creating reports pulled directly from the database. Currently, requests for reports have to go through IT and can take a lot of time and include a lot of back-and-forth negotiation which can hinder responding to business needs (EMC Education, 2015). If there was a way for necessary staff to create bespoke reports with the needed data, it will eliminate the need for manual transformation and aggregation which can lead to breaches due to human error.</p>

							<h3>Summary Post</h3>
							<p>Over recent weeks, I have been engaged in a discussion regarding GDPR (European Parliament, 2016) and its implementation in our sectors. In my post, I discussed how my workplace had successfully utilized Master Data Management (Profisee, 2018) to keep data secure, accurate and updated. I also identified some processes around data that could have been improved to increase security and efficiency.</p>

 <p>Our data warehouse is cloud-based and any changes are updated simultaneously.  The data is access-controlled so accounts with the relevant permissions are needed in order to view, input or change data. For example, I am able to view and update data in the system as part of my role but I am unable to create completely new entries. Overall the system is effective, but some reports need to be manually created/aggregated using data downloaded from the warehouse. This process is open to more human error which could have negative impacts on data security. As mentioned in Data Science and Big Data Analytics (EMC Education, 2015), any changes can take a lot of resources and many IT departments can be reluctant to give that level of access to the data warehouse so improving this process may prove difficult.</p>

<p> I found the other contributions by my colleagues to be very interesting and insightful. In particular, the contribution made by Tsz Yeung, Jeffery Ng highlighted many of the benefits of both GDPR and MDM in their sector. I was particularly interested in the use of test data and protected environments for the development cycle, and wondered if this and data protection would ever hinder development. However, Jeffery’s opinion was that data protection aided in reducing errors as people stuck to established best practices.</p>

<p> The second contribution that I found to be enlightening was that of Aneil Maharaj. Aneil’s account of data protection in the aviation industry gave an insight into the importance of data protection, not just in regards to personal data, but also in keeping track of various business operations. He mentions that a lack of MDM (Profisee, 2018) in certain maintenance tasks can mean that outdated processes take place. He says that a central data repository could help with tracking the operations and eliminating this issue.</p>

<p> In conclusion, this exercise has highlighted the importance of GDPR and MDM to a business. I appreciate the variety of sectors we were able to discuss as I believe this has highlighted the importance of these concepts. Whilst scepticism around GDPR, its effectiveness and its long-term impact does persist (Heine and Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021), it is obvious from this discussion that the regulation is a positive influence on data management.</p>
