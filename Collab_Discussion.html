							<h1>Collaborative Discussion</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>During weeks 1-3 of the course, I took part in a colaborative online discusison forum with the my course colleagues. In this assignment, my goal was to dive deeper into discussions around the future of data science as a career but also as a part of the rise of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the assignment and found articles and data that, not only caught my interest, but also challenged my perceptions.</p>
              <p>Below is my final summary of the discussions had and my final thoughts. One thing I particularly enjoyed about this assignment was looking at some of the data and information gathered by various governments and surveying bodies around the current state of data science. I was surpised to learn that countries such as the UK and the US actually report significant skills gaps betweent the data science roles available and the job seekers.</p>
              <p>Below you can find my initial post made in the discussion and my summary which was posted after 2 weeks of reading and responding to my course colleagues.</p>

									<h3>Assignment</h3>
									<blockquote><b>Read the following two articles:</b><br/>
Saxena, P. (2021) There Will Be a Shortage of Data Science Jobs in the Next 5 Years?<br/>
Yildirim, S. (2020) The Dark Side of the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.<br/>
Discuss your views on the future of the data scientist. Identify the role and responsibilities of the data scientist.<br/>

<p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth. It will be a component of the e-portfolio, which you can submit at the end of the module for formative feedback.</p>

<p><b>Learning Outcomes:</b><br/>
Demonstrate a critical awareness of roles and responsibilities (legal, ethical, social and professional) of a Data Science professional.<br/>
Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets.</p></blockquote>

							<h3>Initial Post</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/laptop with hands.jpg" alt="A woman typing on a laptop." /></spanI found both articles to be very interesting and thought they provided some valuable insight into the current job market for data science professionals. However, There Will Be a Shortage of Data Science Jobs in the Next 5 Years? (Saxena, 2019) struck me as simplistic in its suggestion that there will be a shortage of jobs within five years as companies will lean more toward automated machine learning that only requires a single employee to operate. However, I do see a lot of valuable insight in Yıldırım’s article on the challenges data scientists face in a job market that is constantly reacting to new developments (Yıldırım, 2020). Looking at the current prospects for data scientists two years on from these articles, it is clear there is still plenty of growth to be seen.</p>

<p> My prediction for the future of the data scientist is that it will continue to grow as more companies and sectors look to exploit AI, big data and machine learning. By looking at the current state of the job market, it is obvious that there is still a gap in data skills and an appetite to upskill existing staff members.  A recent report from the UK government cited that there is a significant data skills gap in the UK workforce which is impacting companies filling vacancies. For example, it is reported that 49% of firms reported a lack of candidates with technical skills and over 50% reported that staff did not have the required skills in AI, algorithms and programming skills (UK Government, 2021). A similar picture is seen in the United States, evidenced in a July 2023 report from the White House regarding "...empowering Americans to pursue these career paths in cyber." (The White House, 2023). This is in stark contrast to Saxena’s assertion that there would be a job shortage and instead we are currently seeing the opposite. The assumption we can come to is that companies will opt to upskill and train staff, as claimed in the previous government report where 62% of firms reported that staff had received internal or external AI training 12 months prior (UK Government, 2021).</p>

<p> More recently, the World Economic Forum has reported that AI and Big data are key skills that companies will be addressing in their upskilling and reskilling strategies between 2023 and 2027 (World Economic Forum, 2023).  This is more in line with the assertions made by Yıldırım regarding the constant need to retrain and update skills as the world of data science continues to shift and develop (Yıldırım, 2020).</p>

<p> To summarise, I believe the data scientist role and opportunities will continue to grow as companies look at implementing AI and machine learning into it’s business practices. I also believe that companies will look at upskilling existing staff members with strong domain knowledge and expertise so these tools can be used to the fullest extent within the business context. I do believe that the importance of business domain knowledge will grow in the future as more sectors look to utilise AI (Bass, 2018), and data scientists and services will also become more focused on specific sectors.</p>

							<h3>Summary Post</h3>
							<p>Over the course of the first 3 weeks of the module, I have been discussing the future of the data scientist with my fellow students.<br />

The current role of the data scientist as discussed (EMC Education Service, 2015; Yıldırım, 2020) includes the following tasks, skills and responsibilities:<br/></p>

<p>•Data collection and maintenance<br/>
•Data cleaning and validation<br/>
•Data analysis<br/>
•Programming of algorithms<br/>
•Mathematics and statistics<br/></p>
<p> My original opinion was that the role of the data scientist will change in the future, but continue to be important. By looking at sources regarding the current job market, it is obvious that much of the workforce is short on skills and experience. Therefore, I do not believe that companies would be able to replace data scientists with AI as this change alone would require skill and experience from a variety of data professionals (Bass, 2018). This is also seen in the Profisee (2006) article, where the author names a variety of job roles and skills necessary to overhaul a company’s data strategy and to maintain it.</p>

<p>The discussions had with my course-mates were also enlightening. One colleague, for example, posed a great question about the role of domain knowledge in the field of data science and how this might develop in the future – will data scientists become domain experts or will they simply collaborate with others (Ghosh, 2016)? Others agreed more with the future put forward by Saxena, where companies would stop employing data scientists and replace them with automated machine learning. Finally, the role of ethics and bias in data was also discussed as a  possible hindrance to future growth and development (Tobin, 2023).</p>

<p> In conclusion of these discussions, my opinion that the role of the data scientist will continue to develop along with how companies use data largely remains the same. It will also be interesting to see if specific, niche domain knowledge will give data scientists more of an “edge” in the future job market, or if technical skills will continue to be the most important. I will also be keeping up with the conversations around data regulation and ethics as this could be a potential barrier in the future.</p>
